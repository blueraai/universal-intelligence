# Task: 3D Interactive Documentation Site for Universal Intelligence

**Objective:** Create a cutting-edge, interactive 3D documentation site that provides an immersive learning experience for the Universal Intelligence framework.

## Phase 1: Core Documentation (Completed)

The foundation for our documentation has been established with a comprehensive set of Markdown files and examples:

```
docs/
├── 00_system_architecture.md - High-level overview with system diagrams
├── 01_overview.md - Project goals and introduction
├── 02_core_architecture.md - Core interfaces and abstractions
├── 03_plugin_architecture.md - Community component extensibility
├── samples/ - Example implementations inspired by ADK patterns
│   ├── basic_agent.py - Simple model usage
│   ├── tool_using_agent.py - Agent with tools integration
│   ├── multi_agent_system.py - Agents working together
│   ├── rag_agent.py - Retrieval-augmented generation example
│   ├── specialized_agent.py - Domain-specific implementation
│   └── README.md - Sample usage instructions
```

## Phase 2: Interactive 3D Documentation Site

The next phase involves transforming our traditional documentation into an immersive 3D experience that will revolutionize how users learn about Universal Intelligence.

### Key Requirements

#### 1. 3D Architecture Visualization
- Create an interactive 3D visualization of the Universal Intelligence architecture
- Components (Models, Tools, Agents) should be represented as 3D objects
- Connections between components should be visualized with animated flow effects
- Users should be able to navigate the 3D space with intuitive camera controls
- Component selection should reveal detailed information about each element

#### 2. Interactive Code Playground
- Implement a Sandpack-based code execution environment
- Allow users to experiment with and modify example code in real-time
- Enable live execution of Python code samples
- Support for Universal Intelligence package usage in code examples
- Secure execution using Docker containers or appropriate sandboxing
- Connect code execution to the 3D visualization (highlighting relevant components)

#### 3. Learning Experience
- Multiple learning modes: Guided Tour, Free Exploration, Concept Map
- Dynamic sequence visualization with animated flows
- Progressive disclosure of information to avoid overwhelm
- Visual effects that illustrate data flow and component interaction
- Links between visual elements and corresponding documentation sections

### Technical Specifications

#### Frontend Architecture
- **React (v18+)**: Core UI framework
- **Three.js & React Three Fiber**: 3D visualization framework
- **@react-three/drei**: Higher-level Three.js components
- **Zustand**: State management
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling
- **MDX**: Enhanced markdown with interactive components
- **Sandpack**: In-browser code execution environment
- **Framer Motion**: Animations and transitions

#### Backend Services (for Code Execution)
- **Node.js & Express**: Server framework
- **Socket.io**: Real-time communication
- **Docker**: Containerization for secure code execution
- **Redis**: Session management and caching

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Foundation (1-2 weeks)
- Set up React + Three.js project structure
- Convert existing documentation to MDX format
- Create basic 3D models for core components
- Implement Sandpack code playground integration

#### Phase 2: Core Experience (2-3 weeks)
- Develop the 3D architecture explorer with basic interactions
- Implement camera controls and interactive elements
- Create documentation panels with proper content linking
- Set up the code execution environment with Docker

#### Phase 3: Enhanced Features (2-3 weeks)
- Build advanced code playground features
- Implement guided tours and exploration modes
- Develop sequence visualizer with animation
- Create concept map views

#### Phase 4: Polish and Launch (1-2 weeks)
- Add animations and transitions
- Optimize performance
- Implement responsive design
- Conduct user testing and refinement
- Deploy to production

### Expected Deliverables

1. **Frontend Application**
   - Complete React application with 3D visualization
   - Responsive design that works across devices
   - Interactive code playground with Sandpack integration
   - Comprehensive user interface for navigation and exploration

2. **Backend Services**
   - Code execution service with Docker containerization
   - WebSocket server for real-time communication
   - Session management and caching system

3. **Documentation**
   - All existing documentation converted to MDX format
   - Enhanced with interactive elements
   - Properly linked to 3D visualization components

4. **Deployment Configuration**
   - Docker Compose configuration for local development
   - Production deployment scripts
   - CI/CD configuration for automated deployment

### Success Criteria

- Users can intuitively navigate the 3D space to explore the architecture
- Code examples can be edited and executed in real-time
- The documentation is comprehensive, visually engaging, and technically accurate
- The system is secure, reliable, and performs well across various devices
- New users can quickly understand the Universal Intelligence framework through the interactive experience
