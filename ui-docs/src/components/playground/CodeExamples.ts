Instead of using bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers use quantum bits or "qubits" that can exist in multiple states simultaneously thanks to superposition. This allows quantum computers to explore many possible solutions at once, making them potentially much faster for certain types of problems like factoring large numbers or simulating quantum systems.'
