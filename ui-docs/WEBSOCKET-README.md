# WebSocket Connectivity Fix

This document describes the WebSocket connectivity fix implemented for the Universal Intelligence playground.

## Problem

The WebSocket connection between the browser client and server was experiencing several issues:

1. **Protocol Mismatch**: Inconsistent WebSocket protocol handling between server and client
2. **Connection Timing**: Race conditions in connection establishment
3. **Headers Processing**: Problems handling different WebSocket library versions
4. **Error Handling**: Inadequate error recovery when connections fail
5. **Logging Overload**: Excessive logging causing performance issues

## Solution

The solution addresses all of these issues with improvements to both the server and client implementations:

### Server Improvements (`server.py`)

1. **Reduced Logging Verbosity**
   - Set WebSocket loggers to WARNING level
   - Added structured logging with client identifiers

2. **Improved Protocol Handling**
   - Added compatibility with different WebSocket library versions (10.x through 15.x)
   - Fixed subprotocol support for 'json'
   - Enhanced CORS headers management

3. **Connection Stability**
   - Added active connection tracking
   - Implemented server-side heartbeat mechanism
   - Better error handling during message processing

### Client Improvements (`src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts`)

1. **Connection Reliability**
   - Added connection timeout detection
   - Improved connection cleanup logic
   - Added explicit protocol negotiation

2. **Reconnection Strategy**
   - Implemented exponential backoff with jitter for more reliable reconnection
   - Added automatic recovery after connection failures
   - Better tracking of connection state

3. **Error Detection and Recovery**
   - Enhanced ping/pong mechanism to detect stale connections
   - Improved error reporting with custom error types
   - Added real-time connection status monitoring

## Testing

### 1. Using the Python Diagnostic Tool

```bash
cd ui-docs/tests
python websocket_diagnostic.py --duration 30
```

### 2. Browser Test

Start your development server in one terminal:

```bash
cd ui-docs
npm run dev
```

Then start the WebSocket server in another terminal:

```bash
cd ui-docs
python server/server.py
```

Visit the browser test page:
[http://localhost:5173/websocket-test.html](http://localhost:5173/websocket-test.html)

### 3. Integration Test

The best test is to use the actual UI components that rely on WebSocket connectivity:

1. Launch the development server and WebSocket server
2. Navigate to the code playground in the UI 
3. Test executing code examples

## Reverting Changes (if needed)

If you need to revert to the original implementation:

```bash
# Restore the server
cp ui-docs/server/server.py.bak ui-docs/server/server.py

# Restore the WebSocket hook
cp ui-docs/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts.bak ui-docs/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the server logs for connection errors
2. Open the browser console to see WebSocket messages and errors
3. Use the diagnostic tool to evaluate connection stability
4. Verify that both the server and client are using the 'json' subprotocol
5. Ensure no other services are running on port 9765

## Technical Details

### WebSocket Protocol

The WebSocket server and client now use a consistent JSON-based message protocol:

```typescript
// Message Types
interface WebSocketMessage {
  type: string;
  [key: string]: unknown;
}

// Example: Code Execution Flow
// Client to Server
{
  "type": "execute",
  "code": "print('Hello, Universal Intelligence!')"
}

// Server to Client (Status)
{
  "type": "status",
  "status": "running",
  "message": "Executing code..."
}

// Server to Client (Result)
{
  "type": "result",
  "status": "completed", // or "error"
  "stdout": "Hello, Universal Intelligence!\n",
  "stderr": "",
  "error": null // or error object
}

// Keep-alive mechanism
{
  "type": "ping",
  "timestamp": 1681234567890
}
{
  "type": "pong",
  "timestamp": 1681234567890
}
```

### Connection Lifecycle

1. **Initialization**: Client connects with 'json' subprotocol
2. **Handshake**: Server accepts connection and sends welcome message
3. **Keep-alive**: Both client and server send periodic pings/pongs
4. **Execution**: Client sends code, server executes and returns results
5. **Error Recovery**: Automatic reconnection on connection loss
6. **Termination**: Clean shutdown with close codes and reasons
