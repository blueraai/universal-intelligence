const _name: string = "mistralai/mistral-medium-3"
const _description: string = "Mistral Medium 3 is a high-performance enterprise-grade language model designed to deliver frontier-level capabilities at significantly reduced operational cost. It balances state-of-the-art reasoning and multimodal performance with 8× lower cost compared to traditional large models, making it suitable for scalable deployments across professional and industrial use cases. The model excels in domains such as coding, STEM reasoning, and enterprise adaptation. It supports hybrid, on-prem, and in-VPC deployments and is optimized for integration into custom workflows. Mistral Medium 3 offers competitive accuracy relative to larger models like Claude Sonnet 3.5/3.7, Llama 4 Maverick, and Command R+, while maintaining broad compatibility across cloud environments."
