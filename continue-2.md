## Instructions

1. Use this document as your guide to continue development of the Universal Intelligence Interactive Documentation site.
2. Check off tasks (`[ ]` → `[x]`) as you complete them.
3. After completing each subtask, add results in the "Result:" section below each checkbox.
4. For each major section, record overall achievements in the "Results Tracking" section at the bottom of this document.
5. Commit your changes to this tracking document as you make progress.

## Revised Approach

Given the challenges with Docker integration, we're simplifying the approach to focus on:

1. Fully leveraging the Sandpack library for code execution rather than building a custom Docker-based solution
2. Implementing a simulated code execution approach for Universal Intelligence-specific functionality
3. Prioritizing the 3D visualization and user experience components
4. Getting a functional product working end-to-end before adding more complex features

## Implementation Details

Below are some specific implementation notes to help guide the completion of these tasks:

### Simplified Sandpack Integration Strategy

Instead of relying on a custom backend server, we'll use Sandpack's built-in capabilities and enhance them with simulated responses for Universal Intelligence-specific code.

1. We'll keep the current Sandpack integration in `ui-docs/src/pages/Playground.tsx` but remove the WebSocket connection to server.py
2. For executing Universal Intelligence code, we'll create a simulation layer that:
   - Parses the code to identify Universal Intelligence components and operations
   - Generates appropriate simulated outputs for standard operations
   - Provides helpful error messages for common issues
   - Stores and manages state between code executions to simulate persistence

```tsx
// Example approach for simulated code execution
const simulatedExecutor = (code: string): SimulatedResult => {
  // Parse code to identify Universal Intelligence patterns
  const parsedCode = parseUniversalIntelligenceCode(code);

  // Generate appropriate output based on identified patterns
  const output = generateSimulatedOutput(parsedCode);

  // Return simulated result
  return {
    stdout: output.stdout,
    stderr: output.stderr,
    error: output.error,
  };
};
```

### 3D Scene Enhancement Strategy

For the 3D visualization in `ui-docs/src/components/3d/Scene.tsx`, we'll focus on enhancing the existing implementation:

1. Optimize the current component models rather than creating new ones
2. Improve the existing lighting and materials for better visual appeal
3. Enhance the animation system for smoother transitions and effects
4. Better integrate the 3D scene with the code playground

### Code-to-3D Integration

To connect code execution with 3D visualization without requiring a complex backend:

```tsx
// Example approach for code-to-3D connection
const highlightComponentsFromCode = (code: string, setHighlightedComponents: Function) => {
  // Parse code to identify which components are being used
  const components = extractComponentReferences(code);

  // Update state to highlight these components in the 3D view
  setHighlightedComponents(components);

  // Return the components for further processing
  return components;
};
```

## Technical Approach Notes

1. **Sandpack Focus**: We'll fully leverage Sandpack's built-in capabilities instead of trying to build a custom execution environment. This will significantly reduce complexity while still providing a good user experience.

2. **Simulated Execution**: For Universal Intelligence-specific functionality, we'll implement a client-side simulation system that can provide realistic responses without requiring a backend server.

3. **Progressive Enhancement**: We'll take a progressive enhancement approach, starting with a fully functional but simplified version, then adding more complex features once the basics are working well.

4. **Performance Optimization**: We'll focus on ensuring the 3D visualization performs well even on less powerful devices, using optimization techniques like level-of-detail rendering and efficient animation approaches.
