# Universal Agents Blockly Integration Plan

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** May 14, 2025  
**Status:** Proposal  

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the implementation approach for integrating Google's Blockly visual programming editor with the Universal Agents framework. The integration will enable users to build, visualize, and execute Universal Agents workflows through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, making the framework more accessible to users with limited programming experience.

## Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goals

1. Create a visual editor for building Universal Agents flows
2. Enable non-technical users to create sophisticated AI workflows
3. Provide a seamless transition between visual blocks and code
4. Maintain the full flexibility and power of Universal Agents

### Success Metrics

1. Users can create any valid Universal Agents flow through the visual interface
2. Generated code is clean, readable, and follows best practices
3. The interface supports all core Universal Agents concepts and patterns
4. The learning curve for new users is reduced compared to code-only implementation

## Background and Context

The Universal Agents framework provides a powerful system for creating complex AI workflows using connected nodes and flows. However, it currently requires users to write code, which presents a barrier for non-technical users. Google's Blockly is a mature, open-source visual programming editor that represents code concepts as interlocking blocks, making programming more accessible.

Integrating these technologies would combine the power of Universal Agents with the accessibility of Blockly, expanding the potential user base and use cases for the framework.

## Technical Design

### Block Structure

The block library will include the following categories:

1. **Core Blocks**

   - Universal Intelligence model blocks
   - Universal Intelligence tool blocks
   - Universal Intelligence agent blocks

### Block Design Example: Basic Node

```
Block Type: universal_agents_node
Inputs:
  - Name: text input
  - Prep Method: statement input
  - Exec Method: statement input
  - Post Method: statement input
