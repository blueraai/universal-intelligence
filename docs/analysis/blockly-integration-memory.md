# Universal Agents Blockly Integration - Working Memory

## Current Status (May 15, 2025)

We're working on integrating Google's Blockly visual programming editor with Universal Agents to create a visual programming interface for building AI workflows. This is being developed on the `feat/blockly-integration` branch, which was branched off from `feat/universal-agents-poc`.

## Implementation Progress

### Completed
1. Created comprehensive analysis document: `docs/analysis/blockly-integration-analysis.md`
2. Developed detailed implementation plan: `docs/plans/plan-blockly-integration-v1.0.0.md`
3. Created example block definitions:
   - Basic Node block: `docs/examples/blockly-integration/basic_node_block_definition.js`
   - Flow block: `docs/examples/blockly-integration/flow_block_definition.js`
   - Model Node block: `docs/examples/blockly-integration/model_node_block_definition.js`
4. Implemented toolbox configuration: `docs/examples/blockly-integration/toolbox_configuration.js`
5. Created working demo UI: `docs/examples/blockly-integration/index.html`
6. Added integration tests: `docs/examples/blockly-integration/test.js`

### Currently Working On
- Testing the integration and ensuring it works properly
- Identifying any issues or improvements needed for the demo
- Ensuring the integration can be extended to support all Universal Agents features

### Next Steps
1. Continue developing the custom blocks for different node types
2. Implement code generation for complex workflows
3. Create a visualization system for flow execution
4. Develop the runtime integration for executing flows directly from the UI

## Key Technical Insights

1. **Basic Architecture**:
   - Use Blockly's toolbox to organize Universal Agents components
   - Create custom blocks for Node, Flow, and pattern implementations
   - Generate JavaScript/Python code that matches Universal Agents API
   - Provide visualization for flow execution

2. **Block Structure**:
   - Node blocks have lifecycle methods (prep, exec, post)
   - Flow blocks connect to start nodes and define execution parameters
   - Pattern blocks provide pre-configured workflows
   - Integration blocks connect to Universal Intelligence components

3. **Code Generation**:
   - Generate clean, readable code from block configurations
   - Support both JavaScript and Python for different environments
   - Include proper imports and dependencies

4. **Integration Challenges**:
   - Browser compatibility issues need careful handling
   - Complex workflows may need optimization for performance
   - Balancing simplicity with power/flexibility

## Branches and Files

- Current branch: `feat/blockly-integration`
- Parent branch: `feat/universal-agents-poc`
- Main development files: `docs/examples/blockly-integration/*`
- Documentation: `docs/analysis/blockly-integration-analysis.md`, `docs/plans/plan-blockly-integration-v1.0.0.md`

## Testing

The integration tests in `test.js` verify:
- Workspace initialization
- Toolbox configuration
- Block creation and connection
- Code generation
- Tab switching functionality
- Saving/loading workspaces
- Flow execution visualization

## Demo Instructions

To run the demo:
1. Start a local HTTP server: `python -m http.server 8000`
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:8000/docs/examples/blockly-integration/index.html`
3. Use the toolbox to drag blocks into the workspace
4. Create connections between blocks
5. View the generated code in the right panel
6. Use the control buttons to save, load, run, or export your flow
7. Click the "Run Tests" button to verify functionality

## Future Vision

The completed integration will provide:
- A full visual programming environment for Universal Agents
- Support for all core Universal Agents features and patterns
- Real-time execution and visualization of flows
- A smoother learning curve for new users

This integration combines the power and flexibility of Universal Agents with the accessibility of visual programming, making complex AI workflows accessible to users with limited programming experience.
