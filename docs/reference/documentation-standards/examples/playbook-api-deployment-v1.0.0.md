# API Deployment Playbook

## Overview

This playbook provides step-by-step procedures for deploying the API to different environments (development, staging, production). Follow these procedures to ensure consistent and reliable deployments.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning a deployment, ensure you have:

- [ ] Access to the deployment environment
- [ ] Latest code pulled from the main branch
- [ ] All tests passing locally
- [ ] Required environment variables documented
- [ ] Database migration scripts prepared (if applicable)
- [ ] Deployment approval (for staging and production)

## Deployment Procedures

### Development Environment

1. **Prepare the Code**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

3. **Deploy to Development**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:dev
   ```

4. **Verify Deployment**
   - Access the API at `https://dev-api.example.com`
   - Run smoke tests: `npm run test:smoke:dev`
   - Check logs for any errors: `npm run logs:dev`

### Staging Environment

1. **Prepare the Code**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   npm run test
   npm run test:integration
   ```

3. **Deploy to Staging**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:staging
   ```

4. **Run Database Migrations (if applicable)**
   ```bash
   npm run migrate:staging
   ```

5. **Verify Deployment**
   - Access the API at `https://staging-api.example.com`
   - Run smoke tests: `npm run test:smoke:staging`
   - Run integration tests: `npm run test:integration:staging`
   - Check logs for any errors: `npm run logs:staging`

### Production Environment

1. **Deployment Approval**
   - Create a deployment ticket in JIRA
   - Get approval from the technical lead and product owner
   - Schedule the deployment during the approved maintenance window

2. **Prepare the Code**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   npm install
   npm run build:production
   ```

3. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   npm run test
   npm run test:integration
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

4. **Create Deployment Package**
   ```bash
   npm run package:production
   ```

5. **Backup Production Database**
   ```bash
   npm run db:backup:production
   ```

6. **Deploy to Production**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:production
   ```

7. **Run Database Migrations (if applicable)**
   ```bash
   npm run migrate:production
   ```

8. **Verify Deployment**
   - Access the API at `https://api.example.com`
   - Run smoke tests: `npm run test:smoke:production`
   - Check logs for any errors: `npm run logs:production`
   - Verify key functionality through the admin dashboard

9. **Post-Deployment Tasks**
   - Update the deployment ticket with the deployment status
   - Send deployment notification to the team
   - Monitor application performance for the next 24 hours

## Rollback Procedures

If issues are detected after deployment, follow these rollback procedures:

### Development Rollback

1. **Rollback Code**
   ```bash
   npm run rollback:dev
   ```

2. **Verify Rollback**
   - Access the API at `https://dev-api.example.com`
   - Check logs for any errors: `npm run logs:dev`

### Staging Rollback

1. **Rollback Code**
   ```bash
   npm run rollback:staging
   ```

2. **Rollback Database (if applicable)**
   ```bash
   npm run db:rollback:staging
   ```

3. **Verify Rollback**
   - Access the API at `https://staging-api.example.com`
   - Check logs for any errors: `npm run logs:staging`

### Production Rollback

1. **Rollback Code**
   ```bash
   npm run rollback:production
   ```

2. **Rollback Database (if applicable)**
   ```bash
   npm run db:rollback:production
   ```

3. **Verify Rollback**
   - Access the API at `https://api.example.com`
   - Run smoke tests: `npm run test:smoke:production`
   - Check logs for any errors: `npm run logs:production`
   - Verify key functionality through the admin dashboard

4. **Post-Rollback Tasks**
   - Update the deployment ticket with the rollback status
   - Send rollback notification to the team
   - Schedule a post-mortem meeting to analyze the deployment issues

## Troubleshooting

### Common Deployment Issues

#### Database Migration Failures

**Symptoms:**
- Error messages related to database schema or data
- Failed migration scripts

**Resolution:**
1. Check migration logs: `npm run logs:migration`
2. Fix migration scripts if needed
3. Run manual migration fix: `npm run migrate:fix`

#### Environment Configuration Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Application fails to start
- Error messages related to missing environment variables

**Resolution:**
1. Verify environment variables: `npm run env:verify`
2. Update environment variables if needed
3. Restart the application: `npm run restart`

#### Performance Degradation

**Symptoms:**
- Slow response times
- Increased error rates
- High resource utilization

**Resolution:**
1. Check application metrics: `npm run metrics`
2. Scale up resources if needed: `npm run scale:up`
3. Enable performance debugging: `npm run debug:performance`
