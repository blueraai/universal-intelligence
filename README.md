## Overview

`Universal Intelligence` (aka `UIN`) aims to **make AI development accessible to everyone** through a **simple interface**, which can *optionally* be *customized* to **grow with you as you learn**, up to production readiness. 

It provides both a **standard protocol**, and a **library of components** implementating the protocol for you to get started —on *any platform* ![lng_icon](https://fasplnlepuuumfjocrsu.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/web-assets//icons8-python-16.png) ![lng_icon](https://fasplnlepuuumfjocrsu.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/web-assets//icons8-javascript-16.png).

<br>

Welcome! Before jumping into what this project is, let's start with the basics.

#### What is an agentic app?

Agentics apps are applications which use AI. They typically use pretrained models, or agents, to interact with the user and/or achieve tasks.

#### What is a model?

Models are artificial brains, or *neural networks* in coding terms. 🧠  

They can think, but they can't act without being given the appropriate tools for the job. They are *trained* to produce a specific output, given a specific input. These can be of any type (often called modalities —eg. text, audio, image, video).

#### What is a tool?

Tools are scripted tasks, or *functions* in coding terms. 🔧

They can't think, but they can be used to achieve a pre-defined task (eg. executing a script, making an API call, interacting with a database).

#### What is an agent?

Agents are robots, or simply put, *models and tools connected together*. 🤖

> 🤖 = 🧠 + [🔧, 🔧,..]

They can think *and* act. They typically use a model to decompose a task into a list of actions, and use the appropriate tools to perform these actions.

#### What is `⚪ Universal Intelligence`?

UIN is a protocol aiming to standardize, simplify and modularize these fundamental AI components (ie. models, tools and agents), for them to be accessible to any developer, and distributed on any platform.

It provides three specifications: `Universal Model`, `Universal Tool`, and `Universal Agent`.

UIN also provides a set of **ready-made components and playgrounds** for you to get familiar with the protocol and start building in seconds.

`Universal Intelligence` standardizes, simplifies and modularizes the usage and distribution of artifical intelligence.

It aims to be a **framework-less agentic protocol**, removing the need for proprietary frameworks (eg. Langchain, Google ADK, Autogen, CrewAI) to build *simple, portable and composable intelligent applications*.

It does so by standardizing the fundamental building blocks used to make an intelligent application (models, tools, agents), which agentic frameworks typically (re)define and build upon —and by ensuring these blocks can communicate and run on any hardware (model, size, and precision dynamically set; agents share resources).

It provides three specifications: `Universal Model`, `Universal Tool`, and `Universal Agent`.

This project also provides a set of **community-built components and playgrounds**, implementing the UIN specification, for you to get familiar with the protocol and start building in seconds.

![lng_icon](https://fasplnlepuuumfjocrsu.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/web-assets//icons8-python-16.png) ![lng_icon](https://fasplnlepuuumfjocrsu.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/web-assets//icons8-javascript-16.png) `Universal Intelligence` protocols and components can be used across **all platforms** (cloud, desktop, web, mobile).


#### Agentic Framework vs. Agentic Protocol

> How do they compare?

Agent frameworks (like Langchain, Google ADK, Autogen, CrewAI), each orchestrate their own versions of so-called building blocks. Some of them implement the building blocks themselves, others have them built by the community. 
  
UIN hopes to standardize those building blocks and remove the need for a framework to run/orchestrate them. It also adds a few cool features to these blocks like portability. 
For example, UIN models are designed to automatically detect the current hardware (cuda, mps, webgpu), its available memory, and run the appropriate quantization and engine for it (eg. transformers, llama.cpp, mlx, web-llm). It allows developers not to have to implement different stacks to support different devices when running models locally, and (maybe more importantly) not to have to know or care about hardware compatibility, so long as they don't try to run a rocket on a gameboy 🙂

### Playground

A ready-made playground is available to help familiarize yourself with the protocols and components.

```sh
python -m playground.example 
```

### Universal Agents Blockly Integration

Universal Agents can be visually designed using Google's Blockly editor. Try the interactive demo:

```sh
python run_blockly_demo.py
```

This opens a visual editor where you can create Universal Agents flows by dragging and connecting blocks. The demo includes integration tests to verify functionality.


## Protocol Specifications

### Universal Model

A `⚪ Universal Model` is a standardized, self-contained and configurable interface able to run a given model, irrespective of the consumer hardware and without requiring domain expertise.

It embeddeds a model (i.e. hosted, fetched, or local), one or more engines (e.g. [transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index), [lama.cpp](https://llama-cpp-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-reference/), [mlx-lm](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm), [web-llm](https://webllm.mlc.ai)), runtime dependencies for each device type (e.g. CUDA, MPS), and exposes a standard interface.

While configurable, every aspect is preset for the user, based on *automatic device detection and dynamic model precision*, in order to abstract complexity and provide a simplified and portable interface.

> *Providers*: In the intent of preseting a `Universal Model` for non-technical mass adoption, we recommend defaulting to 4 bit quantization.

### Universal Tool

A `⚪ Universal Tool` is a standardized tool interface, usable by any `Universal Agent`.

Tools allow interacting with other systems (e.g. API, database) or performing scripted tasks.

> When `Universal Tools` require accessing remote services, we recommend standardizing those remote interfaces as well using [MCP Servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction), for greater portability. Many MCP servers have already been shared with the community and are ready to use, see [available MCP servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) for details.

### Universal Agent

A `⚪ Universal Agent` is a standardized, configurable and ***composable*** agent, powered by a `Universal Model`, `Universal Tools` and other `Universal Agents`.

While configurable, every aspect is preset for the user, in order to abstract complexity and provide a simplified and portable interface.

Through standardization, `Universal Agent` can seemlessly and dynamically integrate with other `Universal Intelligence` components to achieve any task, and/or share hardware recources (i.e. sharing a common `Universal Model`) —allowing it to ***generalize and scale at virtually no cost***.

> When `Universal Agents` require accessing remote agents, we recommend leveraging Google's [A2A Protocols](https://github.com/google/A2A/tree/main), for greater compatibility.

In simple terms:

> Universal Model = 🧠
>
> Universal Tool = 🔧
>
> Universal Agent = 🤖
>
> 🤖 = 🧠 + [🔧, 🔧,..] + [🤖, 🤖,..]

### Usage

#### Universal Model

```python
from <provider> import UniversalModel as Model

model = Model()
output, logs = model.process('How are you today?') # 'Feeling great! How about you?'
```

> Automatically optimized for any supported device 🔥

##### Customization Options

Simple does not mean limited. Most advanted `configuration` options remain available.

Those are defined by and specific to the *universal model provider*.

> We encourage providers to use industry standard [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) specifications, irrespective of the backend internally used for the detected device and translated accordingly, allowing for greater portability and adoption.

#### Creating New Components

For faster deployment and easier maintenance, we recommend using/enhancing *shared* mixins to bootstrap new `Universal Intelligence` components. Those are made available at `./universal_intelligence/community/<component>/__utils__/mixins`. Mixins let components provide their own configurations and while levering a shared implementation. You can find an example here: [./universal_intelligence/community/models/qwen2_5_7b_instruct/model.py](https://github.com/blueraai/universal-intelligence/blob/main/universal_intelligence/community/models/qwen2_5_7b_instruct/model.py).

> Model weights can be found here: https://huggingface.co 

#### Testing

Each `Universal Intelligence` component comes with its own test suite.

#### Running Tests

Installation:

```sh
# (optional) Create dedicated python environment using miniconda
conda init zsh
conda create -n universal-intelligence python=3.10.16 -y
conda activate universal-intelligence

# Install base dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install community components dependencies
pip install -r requirements-community.txt

# Install optimizations for your currect device
pip install -r requirements-mps.txt # Apple devices
pip install -r requirements-cuda.txt # NVIDIA devices

# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Install commit hook
pre-commit install

# (optional) if using the MCP tool, install dedicated MCP specific dependencies
pip install -r requirements-mcp.txt
```

> Some of the community components interface with gated models, in which case you may have to accept the model's terms on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/models-gated) and log into that approved account. 
> 
> You may do so in your terminal using `huggingface-cli login`
> 
> or in your code: 
> ```python
> from huggingface_hub import login
> login()
> ```

Testing:

```bash
# python -m universal_intelligence.community.<component>.<name>.test

# examples
python -m universal_intelligence.community.models.default.test
python -m universal_intelligence.community.tools.default.test
python -m universal_intelligence.community.agents.default.test
```

> Please note that running tests may require downloading multiple configurations of the same components, and temporarily use storage space.
> Tests will be automatically filtered based on hardware requirements.

Clear downloaded models from storage:

```sh
# pip install huggingface_hub["cli"] # Install CLI
huggingface-cli delete-cache # Clear cache
```

#### Writing Tests

Test utilities provide shared test suites for each component type.
