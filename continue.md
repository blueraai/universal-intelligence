## Implementation Details

Below are some specific implementation notes to help guide the completion of these tasks:

### 3D Scene Implementation

The core of the 3D visualization is in `src/components/3d/Scene.tsx`. This component needs enhancement to support:

1. Different viewing modes (guided, free, map)
2. Component interaction with proper highlighting
3. Connection visualization between components
4. Camera controls and transitions

```tsx
// Current Scene structure:
const Scene: React.FC<SceneProps> = ({ viewMode, selectedComponent, onSelectComponent }) => {
  // Component currently uses:
  // - useRef for scene reference
  // - useState for tracking current tour stop
  // - Component positions defined as static object
  // - Connections defined between components

  // Needs implementation:
  // - Proper animation handling for guided tours
  // - Enhanced lighting and materials
  // - Better component interaction
  // - Data flow visualization
};
```

### Code Playground Enhancement

The Code Playground (`src/pages/Playground.tsx`) currently has:

1. A basic code editor
2. Example selection
3. Simulated code execution

It needs enhancement to include:

```tsx
// Current Playground structure:
const Playground: React.FC = () => {
  // Component currently uses:
  // - useState for tracking selected examples and execution state
  // - Basic setTimeout for simulating code execution
  // - Simple output display

  // Needs implementation:
  // - Better code editor with syntax highlighting
  // - More realistic code execution simulation
  // - Enhanced example selection UI
  // - Connection to 3D visualization when relevant code runs
};
```

### Component Integration

The main application architecture needs better integration between components:

1. 3D visualization should update based on code execution
2. Documentation should link to relevant 3D components
3. Navigation should be synchronized across different views

## Notes on Technical Approach

1. **State Management**: Consider using React Context or a small state management library like Zustand for global state that needs to be shared between the 3D visualization, code playground, and documentation panels.

2. **Code Execution**: For simplicity, we're using simulated code execution rather than a full backend. Make sure the simulations are realistic and demonstrate the correct concepts.
